# Rule for README Maintenance

When updating the Draw landing page project:
- Always check if the README.md in trickle/notes needs to be updated
- Update README.md when:
  - New sections are added to the website
  - Technologies or dependencies change
  - Configuration steps are modified
  - New features are implemented
  - Design colors or styles are changed
  - File structure is modified
- Keep the README concise and up-to-date with the current project state
